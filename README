A bash script to monitor changes in BGP data provided by routeviews.org
@tprime_

I) INFORMATION

This script performs the following:
	1) Downloads the latest BGP data from routeviews.org
	2) Identifies the number of peers observed per Autonomous System, as specified by the user
	3) Calculates the change in the amount of observed peers as a decimal percentage
	4) Writes data to a csv file

II) USAGE

Run the routeviews-bash.sh script, specifying the Autonomous Systems to monitor as a comma-seperated argument.

III) INSTALLATION

Routeviews.org updates their BGP data every two hours. For this reason, I recommend using crontab to run the script in two hours intervals:

0 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22 * * * ~/routeviews-bash.sh 123,456,789

IV) OUTPUT

The script will save data to a CSV file with the following information:

date,AS #,# of peers,change %

The 'change' value is represented as a decimal percentage. For instance, .05 indicates a 5% increase in the number of observed peers. -.05 indicates a 5% decrease in the number of observed peers.
